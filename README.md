Simulation of Earth and Jupiter's orbits within our solar system

Sizes of Earth, Jupiter, and the Sun are not to scale. The Sun's gravity affects Earth and Jupiter, but the gravity of Earth and Jupiter do not affect the Sun, nor does the gravity of Earth affect Jupiter and vice versa. Accounting for these simplifications, relative distances to the sun as well as orbital periods should be correct within rounding error.
